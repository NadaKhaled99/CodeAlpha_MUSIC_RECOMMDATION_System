**In Spotify**
![Spotify_Logo](https://github.com/NadaKhaled99/CodeAlpha_MUSIC_RECOMMDATION_System/images/Spotify_Logo.png)

- [ ] Spotify is trying to match fans and artists in a personalized way by their recommendation algorithms their suggested playlist

**Main Target:
1- Giving a million creative artists --> the opportunity to live off their Art**
- (Music-Poem-Podcast-Radio/Live Stream-Book Summaries-Religious Audiobooks)--> So they can keep making art 
**2- Billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired it**

** Features:**
- [ ] 1- Start your own radio from song to another
- [ ] 2- Get delivered discover weekly which give you new music to try out and exclude

**Scale of data at Spotify:**
# 300 M+  Users    on Sep 5, 2023
# 70 M+    Tracks  on Sep 5, 2023  

**Description: [How is Spotify doing this algorithm & How fans interact these songs & How would a user explore all of these songs]**
- 1- To match an artist with a fan in a personal relevant way ...
> An artist creates a lot of tacks or songs 
- 2- These songs are out there on the Spotify for fans to explore
- 3- Fans can search or create playlists or even ask people for  recommendation 

>>> This is a task which require:
- 1- might need a lifetime bits for all these songs or 
- 2- might not know what can we listen

**Challenge:
- How Spotify matches amount of songs to proper users 
- How they do it by using personalized music recommendation which based on your [taste - preference - like- don't like ] 
- Try to find out a song matches with your taste & preference

**Methodology:**
**Try to find out a song matches with your taste & preference to recommend music:**
> Need to:Take some user inputs
> Analyze user's behaviour 
> Analyze what kind of user you are 
> Try to see what other users are doing :( Spotify is creating a connection way be
- A) when a fan listen to a music -->
-          it touches their heart --> 
-          the user enter that fan to explore that artist which creates a very personal ex(pervious song)
-          you know connection between these two entities  (artist & fan)
-          As they are just connected by the music that they share between each other


**Open Spotify app:**
> there are a lot of things which kind of you know like navigate me as a user towards new music or new artist

:**How does Spotify recommend music to users?:**
:**Recommendation Features::**
- [ ] 1. Discovered (personalized recommendation)--->
         - know your daily playlist or discover weekly which gives you new artist new music --->
         - which has come out in this week to know your style
- [ ] 2. Radio --> when click on a song and you can find related artists to the one you are listening
-              --> then there are playlists which are based on your region demographic 
-              --> these playlists gives us opportunity to you know go and find something that we'ill want to listen
- [ ] 3. Related Artists
- [ ]  4. Now Playing

**Recommendation System Definition:**
- AI algorithms and ml models which will analyze users behavior and preferences: 
- like what kind of movie they like
- like what kind of products they buy
- like what kind of music they listen to
- based on this information it tries to recommend users other things which are which might match the user experience

**Spotify system :** is basically all what we see on the app like discover weekly playlist that they recommend the radio feature anything that we use on Spotify is driven

 **How other Industries are using a recommendation system :**
 - basically I think we all use it on in our day-to-day life when we browse YouTube and YouTube suggests are recommended for you  recommend this to be similar to what to what we watched similarly 
 - basically it is a continuous stream of data

**Explanation:**
- [ ] we'll ask you what kind of music you like and then they will introduce you to new music which might be similar to what you just asked for and how do they do it basically they derive the ingredients of that music from your preferences

- AS
recommendation system in other places such as Amazon when you're buying a product you see people have also bought which is again a recommendation system based on you know like what you just bought

- AS
which you are a book reader you might find it in place says like Goodreads where they recommend you books based on what they have liked

**How does a recommendations system work ?** -------------->>>
**Data Pre-processing and Collection :**
- Cleaning and organizing user interactions, such as song listens and likes. Additionally, data collection encompasses gathering user demographic information and tracking behavior to create user profiles. These Steps ensure the availability of high-quality data for building accurate music recommendation models

**Data Exploration :**
- Analyzing user behavior and music attributes to uncover valuable insights.This process includes examining song popularity, user preferences, and demographics trends. Data exploration helps refine recommendation algorithms and enhance the personalized music discovery experience for users

**Feature Extraction :**
- Transforming raw data into relevant features.This includes extracting user preferences, song characteristics, and contextual information.These features are crucial for building recommendation models that understand and capture the nuances of music tastes and preferences to deliver personalized song suggestions

**Model Building & Evaluation :**
- Creating machine learning models that predict user preferences based on historical data. These models include collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms.Model evaluation involves assessing their accuracy using metrics like RMSE and AUC-ROC to ensure that recommendations align with user preferences, enhancing the listening experience.

**Recommendation :**
- Generating personalized song suggestions for users based on their preferences and behavior.This process combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to curate playlists and tracks. Evaluation measures the effectiveness of recommendations using metrics like click-through rate and user feedback, ensuring the quality and relevance of song Suggestions .

**Recommendation System Types :** ---------------------->>

**Content Based Filtering :**

- Recommends items (e.g., songs) to users by analyzing item features and comparing them to the user's profile, focusing on item attributes, user preferences, and relevant

- Recommend songs to the user Mr X, based on songs similar to the one liked by Mr. X
 
**Collaborative Filtering :**

- Recommends items (e.g., songs) by analyzing user behavior and identifying patterns among similar users or items, focusing on user interactions, preferences, and peer influence.

- Recommend songs to the user Mr X, based on songs liked by other users similar to Mr X

**Hybrid Models :**

- Combine content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations by leveraging both item attributes and user behavior, enhancing recommendation accuracy and versatility. 

- Recommend songs to the user Mr. X by blending multiple recommendation techniques, including analyzing songs similar to those liked by Mr. X and identifying patterns in user behavior.
